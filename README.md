The Python based exe is a simple layout. When you download it and run it it will ask you for a key to be able to access the rest of the software. But you will not be provided a key so you must click "submit" a few times and the exe will generate one for you in the directory that it is saved in labeled "secret.txt" just copy and paste it in. you will be granted access to the rest of the software. Then the rest is straight forward. Select the folder you want to be encrypted by clicking "browse folder" and select the folder. Then click "LOCK" depending how much you are encrypting it will take a while and the exe might say "unresponsive" just wait a few seconds and it will work just fine. same goes with Decrypting it browse to the folder and click "UNLOCK".
